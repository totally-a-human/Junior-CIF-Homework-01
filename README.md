### Project 1 - Guessing game
In this project, we learned how to import randit to get a random number and we also had a review on how lists work. 
These then helped us make our actual project which was the number guessing game. We worked on a prototype of the game in the first unit then we finished our polished version of the game in the second unit of this project.
